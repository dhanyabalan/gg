        <p class="intro">Idukki district is a densely forested, mountainous region in the south Indian state of Kerala. In the north, Anamudi mountain towers over Eravikulam National Park, where the rare, blue Neelakurinji flower blooms every 12 years. Nearby, Munnar is a hill station known for its sprawling tea plantations and Tea Museum. Farther south is the vast, curved Idukki Dam and Periyar National Park, a tiger and elephant reserve.</p>

            Hill View Park, one of the Idukki tourist places, located at a distance of 2 km from Idukki Bus stand, is a magnificent and well-managed park. The park, stretching over 8 acres enthralls the visitors with hundreds of varieties of crotons, flowers, medicinal plants, and other woods.

The Hill View Park houses a natural water body, where visitors can enjoy boat rides.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> The view from the watchtower of both the dams, Idukki and Cheruthoni, the surrounding hills on all four sides and the lush greenery takes the breath away.

The Park remains open throughout the year and can be accessed through gentle slopes, though it is stationed at 350 ft above the level of Dam water. The herbal garden and childrenâ€™s play area add appeal to the Hill View Park.

Distance: 2 km from Idukki.

Entry Fees: Rs. 10 for adults and Rs. 5 for Children.
